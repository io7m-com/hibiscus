## Hibiscus

An API specification for simple RPC clients.

## Motivation

Many [io7m](https://www.io7m.com/) projects implement some form of RPC client.
The Hibiscus API is an attempt to define some common interface types so that
unrelated projects nevertheless end up with a consistent look and feel across
client implementations.
